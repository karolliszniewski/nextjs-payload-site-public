#### This project was initially created using the following command:

```bash
npx create-payload-app
```

#### Collection and Data

After creating the project, I added a new collection and populated it with data.
The Pins are fetched from an endpoint defined using Payload CMS. A NoSQL database is connected to Payload, allowing it to read and write data. This is achieved by simply adding the collection to the `payload.config.ts` file.

#### Location Pages

For creating location pages, I created the file `src/app/(frontend)/location/[slug]/page.tsx`, which is automatically treated as a dynamic slug route.
Here, a JSON object is fetched, and based on that data, information about the specific location is displayed.

#### Contact Form

I also implemented a contact form that displays the form content once submitted.
